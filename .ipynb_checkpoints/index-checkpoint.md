#### _Paul Dirmeyer_

## A place for useful and fun Python code I've written

**[Soundings](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/tree/main/Soundings)** - Code to produce detailed skew-T log-P thermodynamic diagrams. Uses the data server at the University of Wyoming as a source of current and historical sounding data. Customizable to include shading of CAPE and CIN, stability regimes, printing of key quantities.
* [Module](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Soundings/sounding_plotter.py) 
* [Notebook](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Soundings/Sounding_Plotter.ipynb) showing examples.

**[Gradient_maker](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/tree/main/Gradient_maker)** - Module to generate custom color palettes and colormaps for use in `matplotlib` - with a number of samples and examples.
* [Documentation](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Gradient_maker/Gradient_maker_documentation.md) including the background, motivation and color theory. 
* [Module](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Gradient_maker/gradient_maker.py) 
* [Notebook](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Gradient_maker/Gradient_maker_example.ipynb) showing examples.

**[Games](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/tree/main/Games)** - A place for games.
* [SoccerLeague](https://github.com/pdirmeyer/Python_gizmos/blob/main/Games/SoccerLeague.ipynb) - Create and run your own pseudo Premier League football season. Generates realistic match and table results based on team ratings.
