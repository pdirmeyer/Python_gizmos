    "Every new programming language I have ever learned I would write the same program, which was the very first program of my own creation I ever coded. It reproduced the play of a dice baseball game, where each roll of 2 6-sided dice gave the result of one at-bat.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time I came to learn Python, I wanted to do something different. So I developed an algorithm to reproduce the results of Premiere League matches fairly realistically. That was written as a Python script. This is an adaptation of that program as a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is fairly well documented, and the mark-up cells point out various Python features that may help you learn the basics, just as writing this program helped me learn them. Often the best way to learn a programming language is to explore other people's code. The goal here is not to write the most efficient or _pythonic_ program, but to incorporate many different elements of the language.\n",

    "#### Game play algorithm:\n",
    "* Each match is divided into 30 3-minute intervals (15 per half)\n",
    "* Each interval has a shot probability for each team\n",
    "    * Home team gets first chance to have a shot in an interval (only one shot allowed per interval) - this conveys home pitch advantage because if they take a shot, the opposition does not get a chance in that interval\n",
    "    * Each team's odds of taking a shot are determined by a combination of their offensive and opponent's defensive ratings\n",
    "* If there is a shot, it has an on-target probability determined only by the shooting team's offensive rating\n",
    "* If the shot is on goal, it has a probability to get past the keeper based on the keeper's rating\n",
    "* Best of all, **no VAR**!\n"
